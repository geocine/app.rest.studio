# app.rest.studio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/naivefun/app.rest.studio.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/naivefun/app.rest.studio)

It is in early stage and not fully functional. Some configuration is hard coded for now.

This project will need chrome + extension to fix CORS issue. (if the server side is configured to accept request from app.rest.studio)

The target is to be able to deploy on your own machine easily. Stay tuned. :)
